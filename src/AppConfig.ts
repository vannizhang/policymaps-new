        "description": "Understanding the state of humans in crisis and at-risk populations presents decision makers with opportunities to intervene. With access to datasets on homelessness, opioid abuse, housing, infrastructure, poverty, education and more, you are given the chance to ensure a stronger tomorrow for everyone."
    },

        "title": "Economic Opportunity",
        "description": "A better quality of life for all, is what communities strive for. Removing the barriers to affordable housing, jobs, education, health care, and transportation are just some of the factors that need to be overcome. Bringing about understanding through these datasets will demonstrate where stresses exist and can be diminished. "
    },

        "title": "Infrastructure",
        "description": "Communities are seeing massive demographic shifts, lifestyle changes, and advances in technology that effect our infrastructure and transportation networks. These datasets provide the opportunity to rebuild, rethink and reimagine how we strengthen our communities."
    },
    {
        "title": "Resilience and Sustainability",
        "description": "Major chronic stresses and acute shocks have raised our awareness that our communities are not always prepared, not always ready to respond, nor in a position to mitigate the potential impacts. Analyzing data such as fiscal trends, climate patterns, urban development and natural disasters are among the top indicators that allow us to survive, adapt and overcome."

        "title": "Environment and Natural Resources",
        "description": "We recognize the need to pay more attention to the impacts of development, reliance on natural resources, weather patterns, and how even the smallest of species can change an entire ecosystem. Using these datasets, we must deploy policy decisions that reverse over-mining, deforestation, impacts of development on habitats, and reliance on fossil fuels."
    },
    {
        "title": "Public Safety",
        "description": "Creating a safe and secure community is hindered by the rise in natural disasters that have placed new stresses on emergency personnel, the need to shift to more community-oriented methods, and the emphasis on a more collaborative approach across jurisdictions and disciplines. Through these datasets you can improve understanding and take action by looking at historic events, system failures, patterns, crisis response, and resource allocation."
