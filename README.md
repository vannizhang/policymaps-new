# Esri Maps for Public Policy Site

Esriâ€™s Public Policy site gives you instant access to hundreds of policy maps that reveal important facts about your community.

At [this site](esri.com/policymaps), you can explore issues, such as housing, healthcare, or education, across the country or just in your community.  Build a map collection, and easily share it with stakeholders to inform policy decisions.

## Getting Started 

Before we begin, make sure you have a fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point. 

To begin, clone this repository (or your fork) to your computer:

```sh
https://github.com/vannizhang/policymaps-new.git
```

From the project's root directory, install the required packages (dependencies):

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the app 
Now you can start the webpack dev server to test the app on your local machine:

```sh
# it will start a server instance and begin listening for connections from localhost on port 8080
npm run start
```

## Deployment
To build the app, you can simply run:

```sh
# it will place all files needed for deployment into the /build directory 
npm run build
```
